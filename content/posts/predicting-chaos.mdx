Hey, letâ€™s talk about programming.

Programming is hard. _It's only slightly removed from pure thought-stuff_.

Not only that, but it's often trying to undersand someone elses 'pure thought stuff' - to a deadline.

All programmers have horror stories of particularly difficult or particularly _legacy_ codebases. But no project starts off as difficult or legacy. It gets there, one-well-meaning-commit at a time.

As codebases get bigger (and _noiser_) each addition slightly steepens the difficulty curve.

Before long, it's chaos.

We've built a tool to help developers understand their code, and give them an unbaised view on how they actaully work on it.

Your Jira isn't even slightly accurate.

We aren't interested in the code itself - and we really aren't interested in your framework of choice. Github (and by extension git) contains a wealth of unused data about how your project was built, down to the first commit to master. By leveraging information you're already generating, git-chaos doesn't require any setup - just give it a github url and start learning.

Our goal is to help you understand your 'pure thought stuff' a little better.

Let us know what you think.
